		<h3>Stellar Run</h3>
			<div class="text">
				<P>My first video game project began with stellar run. The concept behind this game was inspired by the video game classic Galaga. This project began some time after taking my first object oriented programming course in which Java was used. Java was my first programming language therefore it was what this game was created with. </P>
				<p>Many aspects of this game where inspired by other video games. For example the main menu of this game was inspired by the video game Minecraft's main menu. The menu is conprised of the title up top and centered and then its followed by centered boxes that have different options. The in game healthbar is another example and it was inspired by the nintendo 64 Legend of Zelda games in which they used it instead as the amount of mana left. We shall prevail in this world wether you want us to or not</P>
